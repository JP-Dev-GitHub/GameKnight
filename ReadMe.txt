Step 1: Fill out a Google sheet on your hosts Google Drive. Share the sheet with all game knight participants and ask that they fill out the games they own. (If you already have a Google sheet with your participants and games filled out, skip to Step 2.)
  
 - Format: the first row in the sheet are the names of games, the first column of the sheet are names of participants, all cells contain a 0 or 1, default set all cells to 0's and fill in the 1's with games that you own / are willing to play on game night!

Step 2:
StepRun GameKnight.exe

Step 3: 
Give access to your desired Google spreadsheet to Game Knight's email: knights@gameknighttest.iam.gserviceaccount.com

- Click "Share" and add the email above to your list of contributors

Step 4:
Specify your game night requirements using the provided GUI
- If you want to vote amongst several games using a third part (i.e. Survey Monkey) then check the 'Ballot' box before submitting. You can edit the Ballot Option with the number of games you want on the ballot

Step 5:
Click 'Let's Play!' 
- This will prompt you for a comma seperated list of users who cant make it to the game night ;(
- Ex: "george, kyle, rodrigo, alyssa"
- Make sure their name in the list matches their name on the Google sheet
- Game Knight will then find a game for you and your participants to enjoy!
